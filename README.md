Dynamic Programming: Value and Policy Function Iteration with Interpolation
Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing Value Function Iteration (VFI) and Policy Function Iteration (PFI) using the Bellman Equation. The primary goal of this project was to learn the concepts of dynamic programming and apply interpolation techniques to approximate value and policy functions.

What I Learned and Implemented
Value Function Iteration (VFI): Iteratively updates the value function until an optimal solution is reached.
Policy Function Iteration (PFI): Works directly on the policy function to achieve faster and more efficient results.
Interpolation: Applied interpolation techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the solution.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
